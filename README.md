# Final Project

The company Lending Club provided a dataset including application loan transaction for the period 2007-2020. The request has been to prepare a machine learning model to help predicting the loan Grade.

The project is divided into different section:

# Data cleaning
Actions have been performed to prepare the datset for the next steps and anlysis:

Sub sections:
- Initial dropping of columns not needed
- Text column treatment
- Null values treatment & Label encoder
- Duplicates treatment


# Exploratory analysis

An investigation to gain insights and understand more about the dataset. 

Sub sections:
- Feature engineering (to add new variables)
- Statistical measure and Outliers
- Relationship analysis
- Feature scaling

# Machine learning models

After all the preparatory steps, different models have been prepared and tested to predict Grade loan.

Sub sections:
- Logistic regression
- Random forest
- Rebalancing
- Hyperparameters tuning
- Features selection
- Neural network

The initial Random forest model has been tested vs the Logistic regression. After that, different steps have been performed to improve the performance.
A final neural network model has been tested vs the Random forest with feature selection model that recorded the best performance in predicting the loan Grade.
