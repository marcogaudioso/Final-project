# Execution instructions

Run the following in terminal window 1: `streamlit run app-v<app_number>.py`, e.g. `streamlit run app-v1.py`

# Version control

## v1 - Simple chat

Key features:

- Simple UI, chat bot with ChatGPT
- Unconstrained - ask any questions

## v2 - Add context through prompt engineering

Let's implement some basic prompt engineering.

The bot will now only help with questions about DSIF Bank's Current Account product based on some additional information coming from FAQs and previous engagement history.

Also, we can add a nice visual at the top.

## v3 - With some fine tuning

Let's implement some basic fine tuning.

To fine-tune our app to focus on questions about DSIF Bank's Current Account product, we will provide it with a dataset of relevant prompts and completions. This dataset will help the model learn the nuances of the Current Account product and provide more accurate and informative responses.

[When should I use fine-tuning vs embeddings / retrieval augmented generation?](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/when-should-i-use-fine-tuning-vs-embeddings-retrieval-augmented-generation)

Embeddings with retrieval is best suited for cases when you need to have a large database of documents with relevant context and information.

By default OpenAIâ€™s models are trained to be helpful generalist assistants. Fine-tuning can be used to make a model which is narrowly focused, and exhibits specific ingrained behavior patterns. Retrieval strategies can be used to make new information available to a model by providing it with relevant context before generating its response. Retrieval strategies are not an alternative to fine-tuning and can in fact be complementary to it.
